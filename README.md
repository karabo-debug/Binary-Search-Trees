# Binary-Search-Trees
The goal of this assignment is to compare the Binary Search Tree with a traditional unsorted array data structure, both implemented in Java, using an application to obtain daily vaccination numbers for a list of countries.   A more elaborate application could offer additional functionality but we focus on just this feature for this assignment.
